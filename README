Solitaire Player is a Python program that deals and plays multiple games of Klondike Solitaire in order to find a winning strategy for this game.  

It has been written in Python 3.2 using IDLE.

It's the first program that I wrote completely from scratch, and the style leaves something to be desired.

The game currently plays something of a blind MaxiMax strategy:  it always pushes forward, trying to shrink the biggest hidden piles first.  It does not, for example, take into account a king two cards back in the dealt pile that could be placed on the board if a small stack could be eliminated.  

Solitaire Player loses a little over $17 a game currently, which is not bad, but it's not ready yet to buy some new shoes and go to Vegas…
