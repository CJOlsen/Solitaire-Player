Solitaire-Player is a program to osearch for a winning solitaire algorithm
It deals and plays multiple games to find the expected value of each playing
style.

After a long period of abandonment I've restarted work on it pretty much
from scratch, moving to Python 2.7.3 from 3.x and more closely following
the OOP paradigm.

At current it is little more than an incomplete skeleton.
