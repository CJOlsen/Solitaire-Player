Solitaire-Player is a program to osearch for a winning solitaire algorithm
It deals and plays multiple games to find the expected value of each playing
style.

After a long period of abandonment I've restarted work on it pretty much
from scratch, moving to Python 2.7.3 from 3.x and more closely following
the OOP paradigm.

At current it is little more than an incomplete skeleton.

Solitaire Player is a Python program that deals and plays multiple games of Klondike Solitaire in order to find a winning strategy for this game.  

It has been written in Python 3.2 using IDLE.

It's the first program that I wrote completely from scratch, and the style leaves something to be desired.

The game currently plays something of a blind MaxiMax strategy:  it always pushes forward, trying to shrink the biggest hidden piles first.  It does not, for example, take into account a king two cards back in the dealt pile that could be placed on the board if a small stack could be eliminated.  

Solitaire Player loses a little over $17 a game currently, which is not bad, but it's not ready yet to buy some new shoes and go to Vegasï¿½
